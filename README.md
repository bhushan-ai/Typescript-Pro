## ðŸš€ About TypeScript
TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.  
It helps in catching errors at **compile time** and improves developer productivity with features like:
- Static typing
- Interfaces & type aliases
- Generics
- Enums
- Modern JavaScript features with backward compatibility
